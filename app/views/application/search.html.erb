        We could have written document_path(id: doc.id, slug: doc.slug, ref: maybe_ref);
        but it's better to use the link_resolver, as it allows you to maintain in one place
        the way all the documents' URLs are supposed to be written, whatever their types.

<p>
  <%= link_to "Back to home", root_path(ref: maybe_ref) %>
  <%#
    Passing the ref parameter allows to keep it if we're previewing a future release.
    Note: if @ref is the master ref, then @maybe_ref is nil (allowing to discard the parameter here).
